;; Crowdsourced collection of tools for LLMs in Emacs

;;; Code:

(require 'seq)
(require 'cl-lib)

(defvar llm-tool-collection--all-tools nil
  "A list of all tool definition symbols.")

(eval-and-compile
  (defun llm-tool-collection--name-to-symbol (name)
    "Convert tool NAME into a namespaced symbol by prepending `llm-tc/'."
    (intern (concat "llm-tc/" (symbol-name name))))

  (defun llm-tool-collection--make-llm-name (name)
    "Replace dashes with underscores to make tool NAME LLM-friendly."
    (string-replace "-" "_" (symbol-name name))))

(defvar llm-tool-collection-post-define-functions nil
  "Functions called after defining a new LLM tool.
Each function is called with one argument, the tool's plist definition.")

(defmacro llm-tool-collection-deftool (name specs args description &rest body)
  "Declare a generic LLM tool named NAME.

SPECS should be a plist specifying the standard attributes of an LLM
tool:

- :name. The LLM-friendly name for the tool. If not set, the NAME
  argument (with dashes replaced with underscores) will be used by
  default.

- :category. Required. A string categorizing the tool, such as
  \"filesystem\", \"buffers\", \"system\".

- :tags. A list of symbols for tagging the tool to enable more precise
  filtering. These can be arbitrary symbols, such as `buffers',
  `introspection', `programming', `editing'.

SPECS may also contain other extra keywords used by specific clients.
Conformant clients should ignore all unsupported keywords. Recommended
examples:

- :confirm. Boolean flag to indicate whether user confirmation should be
  requested before executing the tool (used by `gptel').

- :include. Boolean flag to indicate whether the tool result should be
  included as part of the LLM output (used by `gptel').

ARGS is a list where each element is of the form

  (ARGNAME \"DESCRIPTION\" :type TYPE [...]).

Arguments after the special symbol `&optional' are marked as optional.
TYPE and further properties [...] can include:

- :type. Required. One of the symbols string, number, integer, boolean,
  array, object, or null.

- :enum. For enumerated types, a vector of strings representing allowed
  values. Note that :type is still required even with enums.

- :items. Required if :type is array. Must be a plist including at least
  the item's :type.

- :properties. Required if :type is object. Must be a plist that can be
  serialized into a JSON object specification via `json-serialize', with
  the exception that :type specifications in this plist must be symbols.

- :required. For object types, a vector of strings listing required
  object keys.

For example, a weather tool might have ARGS defined as:

  ((location \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\" :type string)
   &optional
   (unit \"The unit of temperature, either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'\"
         :type string
         :enum [\"celsius\" \"fahrenheit\"]))

This would translate to a tool specification, in the sense described at
the URL
`https://github.com/ahyatt/llm/discussions/124#discussioncomment-11877109',
with args:

  ((:name \"location\"
    :type string
    :description \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\")
   (:name \"unit\"
    :type string
    :enum [\"celsius\" \"fahrenheit\"]
    :description \"The unit of temperature, either 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'\"
    :optional t))

DESCRIPTION is the tool's documentation string.

BODY contains the function body.

This macro defines a constant with the tool's specs and a function whose
docstring is DESCRIPTION with the tool's body under `llm-tc/NAME'. After
the tool is defined, it is additionally made available via
`llm-tool-collection-get-all' and `llm-tool-collection-get-category',
and all functions in `llm-tool-collection-post-define-functions' are
called with the tool's spec as their argument."
